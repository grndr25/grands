      <h2>WHAT MADE YOU STAY?</h2>
      <p>written by Aarnav Grandeur </p> <br> <br>
      <p>
       "there are other tables to sit at, why would you sit in mine?"<br><br>
i didn’t say it aloud. just thought it, quietly, a bitter taste i let sit on my tongue.<br><br>
you sat across from me like you knew my silence. like you wanted to watch it unfold. and for a second, i wondered—was it pity? curiosity? boredom? did i look fragile enough to entertain?<br><br>
i don’t remember inviting you. i don’t remember wanting company. this table, this space, was built to be mine. it wasn’t made for comfort. it was where i came to disappear. not heal. not to talk. just… disappear.<br><br>
but you made yourself at home.<br><br>
you asked about my day like it wasn’t obvious i’ve stopped counting. you pointed out the weather like it wasn’t always raining in my head. and when i didn’t respond, you stayed. and that’s what pissed me off the most—you stayed.<br><br>
i didn’t ask you to stay, but you did—quietly, stubbornly, like the silence didn’t rattle in your ears the way it screamed in mine. you sat there with your hands folded, your voice soft, offering pieces of nothing in particular: the sky looked bruised. your coffee was bitter. a dog barked like it knew your name.<br><br>
you didn’t come asking for the story, the damage, the breakdown—didn’t look at me like i was a wound to be understood or a storm to survive. most people come in loud. they want stories. they want wounds. they want the cracked open version of you they can parade as proof—“look how much they trust me.”<br><br>
but you didn't want any of it. you didn’t reach for comfort like it was owed, didn’t plead for softness like it was your right—you let the silence linger, let it press between us until it ached, let me remain a locked door without searching for keys. you sat in the aftermath like it was sacred, not something broken to be swept away, and treated my coldness not as a problem to solve, but as a season you were willing to weather. and maybe that’s what unraveled me—not your presence, but your refusal to retreat from the hollowness.

      <h2>ANINO NG DATING TAYO</h2>
      <p>written by Vellerie Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
sa aking panaginip, ikaw ang laging panauhin—nariyan lamang upang gawin akong alipin.
ang mabigat na katotohanang nais kong burahin, parang tanikalang mahigpit na nakagapos sa'kin—pilit akong itinutulak pailalim sa mga luhang nais akong lunurin.<br><br>
ang panahon ang tunay na salarin, pagkat ito ang hindi sumang-ayon sa'tin.
lahat ay hahamakin, kahit ang tadhana’y aking kukumbinsihin—maibalik lamang ang nararapat na sa akin.<br><br>
ngunit maging ang mga pagkakataong di dapat abusuhin, ngayo’y huli na upang muling ulitin.
sarili ko na lamang ang aking sisisihin, sapagkat hinayaan kitang tuluyan akong lisanin.
ang puso ko’y nananalangin, ito sana’y dinggin—ang tanging hiling: muli kang mahagkan at makapiling.<br><br>
isang pagkakataon lang ang nanaisin—muling maramdaman kung paano mo'ko mahalin.

      <h2>FUCK ME. LOVE ME</h2>
      <p>written by Ihxàncrysvœrn Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
fingers entwine in my tresses, grasping, insistent, rough with urgency. your breath, a searing caress, ghosts over my skin, igniting a shiver that coils deep in my belly, prying my thighs apart. you profane my name, yet your hands sculpt reverence down my spine. you spurn me, yet your body ensnares mine, keeping me precisely where you crave me most. undone—that is what you render me. that is what i reduce you to. the tension between us vibrates like a taut violin string, quivering with something perilous, something saccharine, something neither of us dares to christen. your lips hover just beyond reach, a tantalizing torment, unraveling my sanity one ragged breath at a time.
<br><br>
come nearer. savor me. seize me. <br> <br>
<br>
there is nothing tender in the way your mouth collides with mine, nothing delicate in the way your tongue breaches the seam of my lips, claiming dominion with each fervent stroke. you consume me as one consumes a sin never to be absolved, as though i am the last forbidden indulgence, the illicit intoxication you vowed never to taste again. perpetuate your falsehoods. swear you do not crave this, do not require this, even as your fingers delve into the pliant flesh of my thighs, dragging me closer, wrenching a gasp from my lips. the friction, the inferno, the instinctive cadence our bodies discover—it is inescapable, irrevocable.
<br><br>
you unmake me with every touch. my skin sears beneath your ministrations, my breath shatters, and already i anticipate the bruises you shall imprint upon me. yet, i do not resist. i never do. my nails score down your back, etching my claim, inscribing proof that i was here, that you are mine—even if we masquerade as nothing at all. again and again, i feel you—the crush of your body, the molten reverence of your mouth, the way you whisper my name like both an invocation and a malediction. we are ensnared, undone, devoured by something neither of us will ever elude, no matter how fervently we feign indifference.
<br><br>
unuttered truths linger between us—love cloaked in teeth and fire, devotion concealed in the way you hold me when the tempest subsides. and when we are naught but breathless, fevered entanglement, we both recognize the inevitable. you will never relinquish me, i will never implore you to.
<br><br>
“well, fuck you. i love you.”

      <h2>LIHAM NA HINDI MAIPADALA</h2>
      <p>written by Vyxeān Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
mahal ko,
<br><br>


isinulat ko ito sa gitna ng katahimikan ng apat na sulok ng silid — na tila’y binabalot ng ating mga alaala. pinipilit kong itago sa papel lahat ng nais kong gustong sabihin sayo‚ ngunit kahit ilang beses ko man tangkain ay nabibigo ako. hindi ko mawari kung nais ko bang ipabasa sayo ang nararamdaman ko o pilit kong itatago na lamang ito.
<br><br>
pilit kong isinusulat ang istoryang kailanman ay hindi nabuo. napatanong na lamang ako kung sapat ba ang pagmamahal ko sayo para lang manatili? nakikita mo ba ang tanong ng puso ko sa bawat tinginan nating dalawa? tila ako’y nakakulong sa mga tanong na nais kong itanong sayo ngunit kailanman ay hindi ko masambit.
<br><br>
ang papel na ito ay naging saksi sa mga gabing gusto kong tanungin kung mahal mo ba ako‚ ngunit pinili kong lukutin. hindi dahil duwag akong ipagtapat ang nararamdaman‚ kundi dahil baka sumobra ang aking kagustuhan‚ at ito ang magtulak sayo upang sa akin ay mailang. natatakot ako na baka kapag nabasa mo ang liham na ito ay layuan mo ako. kaya pinili kong lukutin ang mga papel na naglalaman ng mga salita sa puso ko.
<br><br>
minsan ko na ring tinangkang ibigay sa iyo ang lukot na liham‚ sa pag-aakalang mababasa mo pa rin. ngunit‚ mas pinili ko na lang na yakapin ang sulat at damdamin na ito ang iyong presensya.
<br><br>
ito ay liham na kailan ma’y hindi mo mababasa. isinulat ko ito hindi para makita mo ang laman nito‚ ngunit para ipaalala sa sarili ko na minsan ikaw ang naging laman ng salitang bumabalot sa aking isipan.
<br><br>
nagmamahal, <br>
vyx

      <h2>GROTESQUELY GROTESQUE</h2>
      <p>written by Isekaizyáv Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
[trigger warning: mention of death, anxiety, & violence. read at your own risk!]<br><br>


i am alive, yet dead. to all the things i've experienced, i wondered if i was ever alive in the first place. my hands trembled as i heard his footsteps slowly come near me;<br><br>


scared scars sorrowfully sailed.<br>
sacrificed, so she screamed.<br>
seeking such satisfactory sanctions.<br><br>


although my voice thundered, there's no sound that came out. perhaps my throat was experiencing her final drought. the final season indeed, but i am feeling intensive doubt. as his hands reached my hair, i felt my ends sting and my hair slowly giving up from my head, strangled.<br><br>


my breathing hitched as the air from my lungs came out, my tears fell from the side of my eyes as i cried for help. his angered voice vanquished my ears but then... i could hear nothing.<br><br>


treacherous thoughts,<br>
typically treasured them.<br>
taunting threats throughout thyself,<br>
though these thighs tinted tattoos.<br>
therefore — tickled tactlessly,<br>
they took taste to those tears.<br><br>


tempting terror teachers thy treachers,<br>
testified testimonies took them terribly,<br>
treasonous texture. thoroughly territorial<br>
than the thief that threw thumbtacks,<br>
thus these tremendous tax, transeunt.<br>
tough toys, traced touch, tarnished<br>
tempers... tantalized those tails.<br><br>


tainted, therefore thrived<br>
to tyrannize tombs...<br>
thou shall testify to thy whom.<br><br>


the fear would always conquer our entire sanity and taint our souls, for we have been out in the cold. feasible threats that terrorized our minds and trembled our bodies is something we would never break free.<br><br>


could be<br>
f o r g o t t e n,<br>
yes... but never<br>
f o r g i v e n.<br><br>


to every grotesque thing we encounter — some would remain but never exonerate.

ikaw ang pamagat sa tulang aking isinulat—ikaw ang perpektong tula sa bawat metapora na aking nilikha. sa'yo sumasang-ayon ang bawat salita,<br>
dahil ikaw ang pinakamagandang paksa sa bawat talata ng aking akda.<br><br>


nakita ng mga ulap kung paano kita inibig, kahit hindi na magsalita ang aking bibig. nakita nila ang matatamis kong ngiti, saksi ang araw at buwan sa araw-araw kong pananatili—dahil ikaw ang lagi kong pinipili.<br><br>


at kung ang aking tula'y humantong man sa huling pahina, mananatili ka pa rin bilang damdaming di kayang isara. sapagkat kahit mapigtal ang tinta ng aking panulat, ang alaala mo’y mananatiling buhay

      <h2>DRIFTING</h2>
      <p>written by Aloíre Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
she sat by the window again, tracing circles on the fogged glass, the kind only made by breath and boredom. outside, the world moved with purpose—cars speeding by with engines that seemed to hum with confidence, people walking fast with bags full of groceries and calendars full of plans. even the clouds seemed to know where they were going, drifting across the sky in patient, unbothered lines. but inside her chest, nothing moved the way it should. her thoughts scattered like startled birds, and she didn’t know how to gather them back.<br><br>
every morning, she woke up with a heaviness she couldn’t name. not quite sadness, not quite fear—more like an unfinished sentence she couldn’t bring herself to complete. everyone around her asked the same questions: what are you studying? what do you want to do? where do you see yourself in five years? she had learned to smile and say something safe. psychology. maybe journalism. maybe marketing. maybe something creative, maybe something practical. she always left enough "maybes" in her answers to keep herself from falling apart.<br><br>
but the truth was, she didn’t know. not about studies, not about love, not about anything. some days she felt like a shadow of someone else’s expectations, molded into a version of herself that looked good from the outside—quiet, polite, capable. inside, she was a wildfire of questions, a girl made of "what ifs" and "i don't knows."<br><br>
love was another blur, a storm she didn’t know how to step into. she had tried once—tentatively, like dipping her toes in cold water. but vulnerability had teeth, and she’d been bitten just enough to retreat. now, she watched people fall in and out of love like it was a dance they knew by heart, while she stood in the corner, music playing, not knowing the steps. she wondered if maybe some people were meant to be alone, or if she was just afraid of letting anyone really see her—not the version that smiled and nodded, but the one who cried quietly at night and sometimes couldn’t get out of bed.<br><br>
there were moments, rare and quiet, when she felt like maybe it was okay not to know. a sunset would spill gold across her room, or she'd hear a song that made her feel like maybe she wasn’t the only one stumbling. in those moments, she let herself breathe. just breathe. no answers, no plans. just the beat of her heart, uncertain but still beating.<br><br>
she hoped—softly, secretly—that someday she would step out of this fog, that one morning she would wake up and know. know what she loved, who she was, where she was going. but even if that day never came, she promised herself this: she would keep walking, even through the dark. because maybe life wasn’t about finding the answers. maybe it was about learning how to live while holding the questions close, like a lantern in the night.

      <h2>I'LL WAIT</h2>
      <p>written by Vauréthus Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>i’m staring at the balcony outside of my house‚ sitting in a rocking chair with a coffee in my hand‚ slowly blowing it because it’s hot. i’m reminiscing the past‚ thinking how happy the both of us before‚ contented with each other’s warmth‚ contented with what we have. the gloomy afternoon did remind me of how i used to love you‚ i let out a loud sigh‚ the weather changes so fast‚ from being gloomy to rainy. the rain pours outside‚ i’m still in my door‚ waiting for the rain to stop–rocking my rocking chair while reading a book to ease up this longing feeling that i felt.
<br><br>
back when we were young‚ you used to be the sweetest person to me‚ you made me think that i am the most beautiful woman you ever met‚ you give me the assurance that no one can surpass; trust that not everyone can give‚ and you always reassure me over little things. i miss that feeling‚ i miss how you gave me a service‚ how you said you love me and how you said that both of us are bound to be in each other’s life.
<br><br>
and now‚ back to the present‚ i am here‚ alone‚ waiting for your comeback. one day you left‚ saying you have a business to attend‚ you’ll be busy and i understand it. but days‚ weeks‚ months‚ and even years‚ why didn’t you comeback again?
<br><br>
i now remember‚ before we meet you have someone you are waiting for‚ i guess you’re done at waiting for that person—and you let me wait for you. i’ll be here‚ sitting in my chair‚ waiting for you to comeback and appear.
<br><br>
why did we end up like this?

      <h2>THE ROLE I NEVER AUDITIONED FOR</h2>
      <p>written by Valkherine Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>we’re often like actors
playing a scripted role
on a stage,
performing for spectators
who demand our conformity.
we’re expected
to flawlessly play our parts,
adhering to pre-defined
expectations without deviation —
what will happen when
we yearn to break free
from these constraints?
<br><br>


when one considers the prospect of revealing their true selves and unveiling their persona to those who have only ever perceived them as mere characters, a sense of apprehension often ensues. such an endeavor can be likened to playing a dangerous game. some individuals will not accept us for who a person truly is, coercing us to conform to their preconceived expectations — amenable to embrace our true selves, preferring instead that a person adhere to the constraints of the roles they have assigned.
<br><br>


while there are some that will embrace us with open arms, welcoming us into their lives and hearts, others may choose to remain behind their masks. some will only reveal their true selves when it is convenient. and then there are those who will take a leap of faith — revealing who they truly are, risking ridicule and rejection in the pursuit of genuine acceptance.
<br><br>


for those who choose the latter path, it’s not always an easy road to travel. but it offers something even more valuable than success: the knowledge that we have lived truthfully, without any regrets.
<br><br>


it is our utmost desire to be accepted unconditionally. yet, even a human being within themselves fails to embrace who they really are.
<br><br>


what role are you trying to portray?

      <h2>LOYALTY AS GREATEST EXPRESSION OF LOVE</h2>
      <p>written by Valquirixa Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      l o v e is that emotion that every person—we, long for. it is an innate desire in each and one of us. without it, life will be meaningless. love is an essential ingredient of a fulfilling life, for it nurtures our emotions and keeps us alive. love has been ingrained into us since the day we are born. some even believe that love moves the world. it is so powerful that it can make a man conquer anything and everything in this
w o r l d.
<br><br>
while l o y a l t y, on the other hand, can be a difficult term to define, there are three main types of loyalty: institutional loyalty, which is loyalty to a country, monarch, or government; personal loyalty, which is loyalty to a friend, family member, or colleague; and idealistic loyalty, which is loyalty to an idea or a cause. but if i were to explain or define it in a much deeper sense, loyalty is like an unspoken bond.
<br><br>
being loyal is not something you can just say to others—“i am loyal.” no. it is something you have to prove through time, sacrifices, and devotion. now, let me explain why and how loyalty and love are paired with each other.
<br><br>
“when you are loyal, you are loving and when you are loving you are loyal; love remains because it’s loyal, and loyalty exists because of love.”
<br><br>
love is one of the most beautiful feelings here in our world. almost every individual—us—has experienced loving and being loved in life. whether it is in the form of parent love, sibling love, love for our partners in life—husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, or even grandparent love—it is a special feeling that, for some inexplicable reason, can’t be put into words.
<br><br>
when a person finally encounters someone with genuine loyalty, they become acquainted with true love. when one finds someone who never leaves—even in the most difficult times—someone who will never give up on you no matter how many times you fail, then surely this is the person who has the greatest love for you.
<br><br>
l o y a l t y—this is the essence of love. in a romantic relationship, loyalty goes far beyond fidelity or even compatibility (if one measures compatibility by longevity). but in different relationships such as friendship, workmates, and family, i believe most people tend to recognize one’s loyalty more often when something bad occurs.
<br><br>
we must remember that not everyone is going to clap when they see you succeeding. some will get envious and take it more as a competition. but someone who is truly loyal to you because they love you will share in the merriments of your success because that was their goal in the first place: to be a selfless, genuine friend and for all of you to succeed together.
<br><br>
it’s always good to know that you have someone who will stick through the rough times with you. and when they do, you know they are loyal—and that is because they love you. s o m e also say that we should take notice of the ones who pick us up when they see us fall down, but i believe it's just as important for us to pay attention to those who support our success as well.
<br><br>
without l o y a l t y, a relationship becomes meaningless. a n y o n e can have hundreds of people in and out of their life, but to have
o n e genuinely loyal friend is worth so much more. there are already a lot of inconsistencies in life, but the people you share them with shouldn't be.
<br><br>
l o v e isn't just sentiments. it is not controlled by randomness and emotion. it is not the loudest in the crowd of supporters; it is the one who is still there after the crowd has gone home. l o v e is the decision to stay, the decision to serve—it's a decision.

      <h2>KAHLIL</h2>
      <p>written by Vyolieich Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>
nakatayo siya mag-isa sa gilid ng kagubatan, nakatarak ang espada sa lupa, nakatitig sa papalubog na araw. unti-unting nilalamon ng dilim ang liwanag ng lireo sa malayo, patuloy ang pagliyab ng hathoria. sumasayaw sa hangin ang abo at himig ng mga ibon magkasalungat, gaya niya.
<br><br>
lagi nila akong pinapapili. pumili ng panig. ng kaharian. ng dapat ipagkanulo, pero walang nagtangkang tanungin kung ano ba talaga ang gusto ko. isinilang ako sa pagitan ng dalawang pangalan — si mine-a, ang reyna ng liwanag, at si asval, ang apoy ng hathoria.
<br><br>
pwede bang tahakin ng isang tao ang dalawang landas… nang hindi siya mapunit sa gitna?
<br><br>
tuwing binubunot ko ang aking espada, dama ko ang lungkot ng aking ina sa bawat metal na kumakalog. pero sa bawat hampas, naroon din ang pagnanasa ng aking ama.
<br><br>
sabi nila, mas makapal ang dugo kaysa tubig.
<br>
pero paano kung ang dugo mo ay ilog na sabay na humahati?
<br><br>
sabi nila, tungkulin muna bago damdamin.
<br>
pero paano kung tanging damdamin lang ang nagparamdam na buhay ako?
<br><br>
alena. ang alena ko. hindi niya ako nakita bilang prinsipe. ni bilang mandirigma. hindi anak ng digmaan. sa mga mata niya, ako'y isang batang gustong umunawa. kapag kumakanta siya, tumitigil ang mundo. kapag hinawakan niya ang kamay ko, tumatahimik ang apoy sa puso ko. sa kanya, hindi ako sandata. ako’y mahalaga.
<br><br>
at dahil doon, sinubukan kong magbago. sinubukan kong maging higit pa.
<br><br>
pero hindi sapat ang pag-ibig kung abo na ang iyong pinanggalingan.
<br><br>
sumama ako sa hathoria, hindi para sunugin ang mundo, kundi para unawain ang mundong kinagisnan ng ama ko. akala ko, baka pwede kong baguhin ito. baka kaya kong pigilan ang apoy bago nito lamunin ang lahat.
<br><br>
pero ang apoy… hindi nakikinig. nilalamon lang nito ang lahat — kahit ako.
<br><br>
minsan, iniisip ko… kung hindi ako isinilang sa dalawang magkaaway na mundo, mabubuhay pa ba ako? makakalaya pa ba ako?
<br><br>
pero kahit bigyan ako ng pagkakataong baguhin ang lahat… pipiliin ko pa rin siya.
<br><br>
pipiliin ko pa rin ang magmahal. ang lumaban. kahit matalo.
<br><br>
dahil kahit kailanman ay hindi igagalang ang pangalan ko sa lireo, at isusumpa ako ng hathoria… kahit kalimutan ako ng kasaysayan…
<br><br>
siya, hindi.
<br><br>
nakita niya ako.
<br><br>
at sapat na 'yon.
<br><br>
hindi ako naging isa lang. hindi ako lirean. hindi rin hathorian. hindi bayani. hindi rin kalaban. hindi liwanag. hindi rin apoy.
<br><br>
ako ang pagitan. ang katahimikan bago ang sigaw ng digmaan. ang pahinga sa gitna ng kanta niya.
<br><br>
at marahil, dahil doon… hindi talaga ako para sa mga istoryang may masayang wakas.
<br><br>
itinataas niya ang espada, hinahalikan ang hawakan nito, saka ito iniiwan. naglalakad siya papalayo — hindi patungong lireo, hindi patungong hathoria — kundi sa gitna ng mga puno, patungo sa hindi kilala.
<br><br>
sumusunod sa kanya ang hangin, may dalang mahina ngunit pamilyar na himig — isang lullaby mula sa babaeng minsang naniwala sa kapayapaan.

       <h2>HITANO</h2>
      <p>written by Vaughn Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p> ako si hitano. anak ng digmaan, oo, pero anak din ng pag-asa.<br><br>


parang si mira, napunit ako sa gitna ng dalawang mundo—ang mundo ng pag-ibig kay lila sari, at ang mundo ng digmaan. ang pagmamahal ko sa kanya ay isang apoy na nagbigay liwanag, ngunit nag-iwan din ng mga sugat na hindi ko kayang gamutin. ang alaala niya, ang mga mata niya, parang isang panaginip na paulit-ulit kong inaalala. ngunit ang katotohanan, ang digmaan, ay mas malakas kaysa sa anumang pag-ibig.<br><br>


hindi sapat ang dugo para matukoy kung kanino ka. minsan, mas malakas ang pulso ng puso kaysa sa pintig ng pamana. natutunan kong mahalin ang dalawang babae sa buhay ko, si lila sari at si dashna. pareho silang nagbigay ng sakit, pero pareho rin silang nagbigay ng pag-ibig na walang hinihinging kapalit. sa gitna nila, ako ang tulay. sa apoy ni lila sari, natutunan kong tumindig. kay dashna naman, natutunan kong maging isang mapagmahal at responsableng ama.<br><br>


ako si hitano, hindi lamang isang mandirigma. isa akong boses ng bagong panahon. isang binhi ng pagbabago sa lupang laging nilalamon ng kapangyarihan at paghihiganti. kung ako man ay muling papipiliin, pipiliin ko pa rin ang daang ito. dahil sa pagdurusa ko, natutunan kong umibig. sa mga sugat ko, natutunan kong maghilom. sa mga pagkakamali ko, natutunan kong patawarin—hindi lamang sila, kundi pati ang sarili ko.<br><br>


at sa wakas, ako’y malaya na. hindi dahil pinatawad ako ng mundo, kundi dahil pinatawad ko ang sarili kong naging tahanan ng galit. ako si hitano. at sa gitna ng apoy, ako ang liwanag. sa gitna ng digmaan, ako ay isa sa magpapanatili ng kapayapaan sa encantadia.

      <h2>BATHALANG KEROS</h2>
      <p>written by Aloíre Grandeur</p> <br> <br>
      <p>tahimik ang langit ng binyaan… at sa katahimikang ito’y doon ko naririnig ang sariling tinig—ang tinig ng isang bathalang minsang kinatakutan, ngayo’y kinalimutan. <br> <br>
ako'y nilikha upang maging haligi ng lakas at tapang. ngunit sa bawat patak ng dugo sa lupa, sa bawat sigaw ng mga nalugmok sa digma, ako rin ay naging anino ng kapahamakan. sa aking mga palad—ang kamatayan ay sumasayaw, at sa aking bawat hakbang, ang mundo'y nanginginig. <br> <br>
ngunit kailan pa naging sala ang ipagtanggol ang karangalan? kailan naging sumpa ang lakas na ipinagkaloob sa akin? ako’y itinakwil, hindi dahil sa aking kasamaan, kundi sa takot ng mundo sa aking kapangyarihan. <br> <br>
ang mga kapatid kong bathala—sina emre, haliya, ether, arde… silang minsang nakasama sa paglikha ng encantadia—ngayo'y mga alaala na lamang. ako na lamang ang nananatili sa anino, piniling mapag-isa, upang huwag nang makapinsala. <br> <br>
ngunit kahit ang isang diyos na tulad ko’y napapagal.
hanggang kailan ako mananatiling tanikala ng aking nakaraan? hanggang kailan ko ba kakayaning pigilan ang apoy sa aking dibdib? <br> <br>
kung sakaling dumating ang panahong muling tatawagin ang aking ngalan…
matututo na kaya silang makinig—hindi sa sigaw ng galit, kundi sa bulong ng aking puso? <br>
